There’s no denying that WordPress is pretty awesome; it’s powerful, it’s flexible and it’s free! But it’s just too much. I was at the mercy of WordPress with my last site; updating it was no longer a trivial matter and to develop it required MAMP, a database, a few MB of library code and all manner of other things. This isn’t a bad thing per se, but it was certainly more than I wanted to be dealing with.
